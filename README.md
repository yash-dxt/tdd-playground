# tdd playground

This is the place where I gather my knowledge about test driven development & clean code and write about my journey.  

so, tdd at first seems very different. 

coming from *‘not writing tests’* to *‘writing tests that work - after shipping features’* and now to *‘write tests before actually writing code’*

---

started off with reading the book called [clean code](https://thixalongmy.haugiang.gov.vn/media/1175/clean_code.pdf) first - it introduces the concept of TDD to me - chapter 9 it is. main things highlighted: 

- rules of TDD:
    - first law: you may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.
    - second law: you may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
    - third law: you may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test
- author emphasises on the fact that test code is as important as the production code - and keeping that in mind - test code should be super clean too.
- acronym used by the author - FIRST (tests should be Fast, Independent, Repeatable (in any env), Self-validating and timely.

Watched this [video by fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv2uxzhPFl4&t=608s&ab_channel=Fireship) - where he implements a basic stack and introduces TDD. I was going to write a scraper using Typescript - and was doing it using TDD.

Next,

I got a little confused - I didn’t know how to start. There’s this community on discord by [svs](https://twitter.com/_svs_) - and it had a channel called #programming-help. I started a discussion about how to do it. 

General consensus was not to start learning TDD with a scraper. Rather pick up something logic heavy. 

Some of the resources people suggested - are linked below. 

I started off with one of the resources: [learn-tdd](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd)
